# Introduction
We are trying to get NetworkDynamics to run the general nonlinear oscillators.
By creating the graph we can create different enviroments and train different
cases. 
# Examples
**Duffing.jl** - calculates the Duffing oscillators on the network graph

**FitzHug-Nagumo** - calculates the FitzHugh-Nagumo model for the nodes in the network graph.

**Diffusion-optimiz.jl** - Optimization of the network dynamics for the diffusion constant.

# How to use

# Results
The oscillations in Duffing network using the random eigen frequencies chosen randomly around given value $\omega$:
